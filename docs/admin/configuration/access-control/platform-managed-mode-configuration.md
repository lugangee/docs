In **Platform-managed mode** (`ENABLE_USER_MANAGEMENT=true`), user roles and project
assignments are stored in the platform database and managed through the in-app UI
(**Settings → Administration**). This is in contrast to the default Keycloak-managed
mode, where roles and project access are read from JWT claims on every request.

For a comparison of both modes, see the
[Access Control Overview](./index.md#deployment-modes).

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Kubernetes cluster and Helm values file of AI/Run CodeMie Backend and UI
- If migrating from an existing Keycloak deployment: Keycloak service account client with `realm-management` roles in the target realm (see [Create Keycloak service account client](#create-keycloak-service-account-client))

---

## Step 1: Enable Platform-managed Mode

:::warning Both components must be updated
The AI/Run CodeMie backend and the UI must be configured consistently. Enabling only one of them results
in either missing UI controls or API errors.
:::

### AI/Run CodeMie Backend

Set the `ENABLE_USER_MANAGEMENT` environment variable to `true` in the AI/Run CodeMie Backend
deployment.

In the `codemie-api` Helm chart , add `ENABLE_USER_MANAGEMENT` to the `extraEnv` list:

```yaml
extraEnv:
  - name: ENABLE_USER_MANAGEMENT
    value: 'true'
```

Apply the changes to the deployment.

### AI/Run CodeMie UI

The UI must be told that Platform-managed mode is active so it shows the in-app
**Users management** and **Projects management** tabs under **Settings → Administration**.

In the `codemie-ui` Helm chart `values.yaml`, set:

```yaml
viteEnableUserManagement: true
```

Apply the changes to the deployment.

---

## Step 2: Migrate Existing Keycloak Users (existing deployments only)

:::info When is this step required?
Only perform this step if you are **switching an existing deployment** from Keycloak-managed
mode to Platform-managed mode and you are using `IDP_PROVIDER=keycloak`.

For **new installations** where `ENABLE_USER_MANAGEMENT=true` is set from the start, skip
this step entirely.
:::

When switching to Platform-managed mode on an existing deployment, the platform database
has no knowledge of existing Keycloak users or their project assignments. The one-time
Keycloak User Migration reads users and their `applications` / `applications_admin`
attributes from Keycloak and imports them into the platform database.

### 2.1 Configure migration environment variables

#### Create Keycloak service account client

In the Keycloak Admin Console, create a new client in the target realm:

1. Go to **Clients** and click **Create client**.
2. Set **Client ID** to `codemie-migration-client`, **Client type** to `OpenID Connect`. Click **Next**.
3. In **Capability config**, enable **Client authentication** and **Authorization**. Enable **Service accounts roles** under **Authentication flow**. Click **Next**.
4. In **Access settings**, set **Valid redirect URIs** and **Web origins** to `/*`. Click **Save**.
5. Go to the **Service accounts roles** tab and assign the following `realm-management` roles:
   - `view-users`
   - `view-clients`
   - `view-authorization`
   - `view-events`
   - `view-realm`
   - `view-identity-providers`
   - `query-users`
   - `query-clients`
   - `query-groups`
   - `query-realms`
6. Go to the **Credentials** tab and copy the **Client secret**.

#### Configure environment variables

Add the following environment variables to the AI/Run CodeMie Backend deployment alongside
`ENABLE_USER_MANAGEMENT=true`:

| Variable                       | Example value                  | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `KEYCLOAK_MIGRATION_ENABLED`   | `true`                         | Enables the one-time import on startup. Disable after first run. |
| `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_URL`           | `https://keycloak.example.com` | Keycloak base URL (no trailing slash, no `/auth` path).          |
| `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_REALM`         | `codemie-prod`                 | Realm that contains the users to migrate.                        |
| `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID`     | `codemie-migration-client`     | Service account client ID with admin read permissions.           |
| `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET` | _(from Kubernetes secret)_     | Service account client secret. Use a Kubernetes secret.          |

#### Create Kubernetes secret for the client secret

Before applying the Helm configuration, create a Kubernetes secret to store the Keycloak
service account client secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic codemie-migration-secret \
  --from-literal=client_secret=<keycloak-client-secret> \
  -n codemie
```

#### Example Helm configuration

```yaml
extraEnv:
  - name: ENABLE_USER_MANAGEMENT
    value: 'true'
  - name: KEYCLOAK_MIGRATION_ENABLED
    value: 'true'
  - name: KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_URL
    value: 'https://keycloak.example.com'
  - name: KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_REALM
    value: 'codemie-prod'
  - name: KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID
    value: 'codemie-migration-client'
  - name: KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: codemie-migration-secret
        key: client_secret
```

### 2.2 Disable migration after the first run

:::danger Disable after migration
Leave `KEYCLOAK_MIGRATION_ENABLED=true` running beyond the first successful startup will
re-import users on every pod restart, potentially overwriting manual changes made in the
in-app UI.
:::

After confirming the migration completed successfully, remove all migration-specific
variables from `extraEnv`. The following variables are only needed for the one-time import
and must not remain in your configuration:

- `KEYCLOAK_MIGRATION_ENABLED`
- `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_URL`
- `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_REALM`
- `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID`
- `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET`

Your final `extraEnv` should contain only the Platform-managed mode setting:

```yaml
extraEnv:
  - name: ENABLE_USER_MANAGEMENT
    value: 'true'
```

Apply the changes to the deployment.

## Verification

After completing all steps, verify the setup:

1. Log in to the AI/Run CodeMie UI as an `admin` user.
2. Navigate to **Settings → Administration**.
3. Confirm the **Users management** and **Projects management** tabs are visible.
4. Check that existing users (if migrated) appear under **Users management** with their
   project assignments intact.

## Granting Maintainer Role

The **Maintainer** role is a superset of Admin that additionally grants access to budget management. To assign it to a user, run the following SQL against the platform database:

```sql
UPDATE users SET is_maintainer = true, is_admin = true WHERE email = '<user-email>';
```

:::info
`is_admin` must also be set to `true` — the Maintainer role implies Admin.
