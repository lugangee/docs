<details>
<summary><strong>CodeMie 2.29.0</strong></summary>

**Release Date:** May 22, 2026 · [GitHub Tag ↗](https://github.com/codemie-ai/codemie/releases/tag/2.29.0)

<h3>Third-Party Component Updates</h3>

No third-party component updates in this release.

<h3>Configuration Changes</h3>

1. **[BREAKING]** Ingress annotations removed from upstream Helm charts

   :::danger Breaking Change
   These annotations are no longer shipped as defaults in the Helm charts but are still required for oauth2-proxy authentication to work. Add them to the custom Helm values before upgrading to preserve this behavior.
   :::

   The following oauth2-proxy ingress annotations announced for removal in 2.28.0 have been removed from the default values of the **AI/Run CodeMie Backend** and **AI/Run CodeMie UI** Helm charts:

   ```yaml
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-response-headers: X-Auth-Request-Access-Token,Authorization
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: https://$host/oauth2/start?rd=$escaped_request_uri
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: http://oauth2-proxy.oauth2-proxy.svc.cluster.local:80/oauth2/auth
   ```

**Release Date:** May 21, 2026 · [GitHub Tag ↗](https://github.com/codemie-ai/codemie/releases/tag/2.28.0)

<h3>Third-Party Component Updates</h3>

No third-party component updates in this release.

<h3>Configuration Changes</h3>

1. **`viteEnableAnalytics` removed from AI/Run CodeMie UI Helm chart** — this value and the corresponding `VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS` environment variable were deprecated and are no longer supported.

   :::tip Configuration housekeeping
   If the `AI/Run CodeMie UI` Helm chart values still contain `viteEnableAnalytics`, it can be safely removed.
   :::

2. **Infrastructure logs index renamed** — the default value of `ELASTIC_LOGS_INDEX` changed from `codemie_infra_logs*` to `logs-codemie-infra*`. If this value is set explicitly in the deployment, update it accordingly. See [Logs Retention](../configuration/observability/logs-retention.md) for cleanup and retention configuration.

3. **Upcoming change: ingress annotations** — the following oauth2-proxy ingress annotations will be removed from the **AI/Run CodeMie Backend** and **AI/Run CodeMie UI** Helm charts in a future release:

   :::warning Removed from default Helm chart values in 2.29.0
   These annotations are no longer shipped as defaults in the Helm charts but are still required for oauth2-proxy authentication to work. Add them to the custom Helm values before upgrading to preserve this behavior.

   ```yaml
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-response-headers: X-Auth-Request-Access-Token,Authorization
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: https://$host/oauth2/start?rd=$escaped_request_uri
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: http://oauth2-proxy.oauth2-proxy.svc.cluster.local:80/oauth2/auth

<summary><strong>CodeMie 2.27.0</strong></summary>

**Release Date:** May 18, 2026 · [GitHub Tag ↗](https://github.com/codemie-ai/codemie/releases/tag/2.27.0)

<h3>Third-Party Component Updates</h3>

No third-party component updates in this release.

<h3>Configuration Changes</h3>

1. **`USE_POSTGRES` removed from AI/Run CodeMie Backend Helm Chart** — this variable was deprecated and is no longer supported.

   :::tip Configuration housekeeping
   If the `AI/Run CodeMie Backend` Helm Chart values still contain `USE_POSTGRES`, it can be safely removed.
   :::

2. **Post-migration cleanup** — if the Platform-Managed Mode migration has been completed but the one-time migration variables have not yet been removed, this is a good time to clean them up.

   :::tip Post-migration housekeeping
   After a successful migration, the following variables are no longer needed and should be removed from `extraEnv`:
   - `KEYCLOAK_MIGRATION_ENABLED`
   - `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_URL`
   - `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_REALM`
   - `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID`
   - `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET`

   See [Disable migration after the first run](../configuration/access-control/platform-managed-mode-configuration.md#22-disable-migration-after-the-first-run) for the full cleanup steps.
   :::

3. **`LITELLM_PREMIUM_MODELS_ALIASES` format changed to JSON array** — if this variable is in use, update its value from a comma-separated string to a JSON array.

   :::warning Format change required
   The previous comma-separated format is no longer supported. Update `extraEnv` before upgrading:

   ```yaml
   # Before
   - name: LITELLM_PREMIUM_MODELS_ALIASES
     value: "opus,o1"

   # After
   - name: LITELLM_PREMIUM_MODELS_ALIASES
     value: '["opus", "o1"]'
   ```

   :::

4. **`LITELLM_PREMIUM_MODELS_BUDGET_NAME` removed** — this variable was deprecated and is no longer supported. Remove it from `extraEnv` if still present.

   :::tip Configuration housekeeping
   The budget name is now derived automatically from the `budget_category: premium_models` entry in `budgets-config.yaml`. No replacement variable is needed.

<summary><strong>CodeMie 2.24.0</strong></summary>

**Release Date:** April 23, 2026 · [GitHub Tag ↗](https://github.com/codemie-ai/codemie/releases/tag/2.24.0)

<h3>Third-Party Component Updates</h3>

<h4>LiteLLM 1.83.7 (CodeMie 2.24.1)</h4>

Updated from 1.81.0. For details, see the [LiteLLM 1.83.7 Release Notes ↗](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/releases/tag/v1.83.7-stable).

<h3>Configuration Changes</h3>

1. **[BREAKING]** Fluent Bit: Remove `span_id` and `trace_id` from Metrics Logs

   :::danger Breaking Change
   Without this configuration update, **no metrics will be written** to the `codemie_metrics_logs` Elasticsearch index. Apply this change before or during the upgrade to CodeMie 2.24.0.
   :::

   A new `[FILTER]` block must be added to `fluent-bit/values.yaml` to strip `span_id` and `trace_id` fields from CodeMie metrics logs before they are forwarded to Elasticsearch.

   **Why:** Starting with CodeMie 2.24.0, the backend includes `span_id` and `trace_id` fields in its log output. These fields are not accepted by the `codemie_metrics_logs` Elasticsearch index, causing all metrics ingestion to fail.

   **Required change in `fluent-bit/values.yaml`:**

   ```ini
   [FILTER]
       Name         record_modifier
       Match        kube.codemie-metrics.*
       Remove_key   span_id
       Remove_key   trace_id
   ```

   This filter is included in the updated `codemie-helm-charts`. No manual action is required if you are upgrading using the provided Helm charts.

2. **Keycloak Login Theme**

   The CodeMie login theme (`codemie`) is now automatically applied to the `codemie-prod` realm via the `oauth2-proxy` Helm chart.

   **Upgrade instructions:** [Keycloak Theme Setup](./keycloak/keycloak-theme-setup.md)

3. **New Environment Variable:** `INTERNAL_BIND_KEY`

   A new `INTERNAL_BIND_KEY` environment variable has been introduced.
   It is a shared secret for inter-process communication.
   Without it, webhook trigger may fail when running multiple workers (`WORKERS > 1`) or multiple pod replicas.

   **If upgrading using Helm charts:**

   The updated Helm chart automatically creates a Kubernetes Secret with a random value for `INTERNAL_BIND_KEY`.
   No manual action is required for standard deployments.

   :::warning ArgoRollout deployments
   Automatic secret generation is skipped when `argoRollout` is enabled.
   Create the Kubernetes Secret manually and reference it via `security.processAuthSecret.name` and `security.processAuthSecret.field`.
   :::

   **If deploying without Helm charts:**

   Set `INTERNAL_BIND_KEY` to the same strong random value across all workers and pods.
   Generate with: `openssl rand -hex 32`. Store in a secrets manager or Kubernetes Secret.

   See [API Configuration](../configuration/codemie/api-configuration.md#inter-process-communication) for full details.

<h3>Hotfixes</h3>

- **2.24.1** – April 29, 2026

  Updated LiteLLM to 1.83.7. For details, see the [LiteLLM 1.83.7 Release Notes ↗](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/releases/tag/v1.83.7-stable).

| `LITELLM_PREMIUM_MODELS_BUDGET_NAME` | string | `""`        | `premium_models` category entry      |
| `LITELLM_CLI_BUDGET_NAME`            | string | `""`        | `cli` category entry                 |

**Release Date:** March 27, 2026 · [GitHub Tag ↗](https://github.com/codemie-ai/codemie/releases/tag/2.19.0)

<h3>Third-Party Component Updates</h3>

<h4>Postgres Operator Removed</h4>

CodeMie 2.19.0 removes the `postgres-operator` Helm chart (PGO 5.4.3) used for Keycloak's in-cluster PostgreSQL. It is replaced by two new database options:

- **Dedicated database instance** — a separate, Terraform-provisioned database instance for Keycloak (default for Terraform deployments)
- **Shared CodeMie database** — Keycloak reuses the existing CodeMie database instance; a Helm hook Job automatically creates the required database and user on first install

See the [Keycloak Database Migration Guide](./keycloak/database-migration.md) for upgrade instructions.

:::note
Migration to an external database is optional. If you prefer to continue using the in-cluster PostgreSQL, no migration is required when upgrading to 2.19.0.
